This is a PC game developed by Miloslav "tastyfish" Číž with a little help of
Martin Gabriel for devbook.cz's game contest Magické léto 2013. The game hides
nothing, it's source codes for MS Visual C++ 2010 and it's resources are
available for anyone to download, modify and distribute. Allegro 5.1 library
was used for the project.

Author of everything, that means the concept, script, level design, source code
and the resources is Miloslav Číž. Martin Gabriel helped with game testing and
ideas.
