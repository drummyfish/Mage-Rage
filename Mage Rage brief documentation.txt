explains things not mentioned in the source code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Map file format:

Maps are saved in resource folder as files with no extension - the name of the
file is "mapN" where N is the map number. The file consists of text lines in
format:

attribute:value

where attribute is a string identifying some particular attribute of the map and
value is the value of the attribute. The line order doesn't matter but there
should be no extra white or non-ASCII characters. There should be followind
attributes in the file:

description - Description string of the map which will be displayed at the
  beginning. The string is in format englishtext|czechtext. There are no quotes
  in the strings and there may, of course, be spaces.

music - Name of the music playing in the map without path and extension (.wav is
  suggested and resources folder is searched).
  
mia_x, mia_y, metodej_x, metodej_y, starovous_x, starovous_y - Starting
  coordinations of each player character on the map. Those should be whole
  numbers that fit the map resolution. If the value is ommited, the character
  won't participate in the game.
  
environment - Environment of the map. There are four possible environments:
  grass, dirt, snow and castle.
  
width, height - Resolution of the map. Maximum is 30 x 30.

heightmap - This defines the heightmap - the string consists of rows of numbers
  0, 1 or 2. For example the heightmap:
  
  1122
  0122
  1100
  
  will be written as 112201221100.
  
typemap - Typemap defines the type of the terrain squares. Again, it's written
  by rows, each row consisting of letters:
  
  n - normal
  w - water
  c - collapse square
  h - hole
  i - ice
  
objects - List of object on the map. The list is written as (object1),(object2),
  (object3),... Don't forget that there mustn't be any extra white characters.
  General object format is (objecttype,x,y,id1,id2,state). Id1 and id2 are
  special numbers that connect objects so they will affect each other (for
  example a lever will open a door). If two objects have the same id, they are
  linked. If id is -1, it is not used. State is eaither 0 or 1. Concrete object
  formats are as follows:
  
  (ro,x,y) - ro
  (cr,x,y) - crate
  (ic,x,y) - ice block
  (tr,x,y) - tree
  (bu,x,y,id1,id2) - button      
  (si,x,y,"cz czech sign text|en sign text") - sign, the text is with quotes
  (dh,x,y,id1,id2,state) - door horizontal
  (dv,x,y,id1,id2,state) - door vertical
  (fo,x,y) - fountain
  (le,x,y,id1,id2,state) - lever
  (sn,x,y) - stair north
  (se,x,y) - stair east
  (ss,x,y) - stair south
  (sw,x,y) - stair west
  (fl,x,y,id1,id2,state) - flames
  (f1,x,y) - flowers 1
  (f2,x,y) - flowers 2
  (bo,x,y) - bones
  (c1,x,y) - carpet 1
  (c2,x,y) - carpet 2
  (wl,x,y) - waterlilly
  (ga,x,y) - exit gate
  (el,x,y,id1,id2,state) - elevator
  (tw,x,y) - winter tree
  (ts,x,y,id) - teleport (source)
  (td,x,y,id) - teleport (destination)
  (st,x,y) - statue
  (or,x,y) - Oren
  (kr,x,y) - red key
  (kg,x,y) - green key
  (kb,x,y) - blue key
  
monsters - List of monsters on the map. Monster list follows the same syntax as
  the map object list. The inside of the brackets looks like:
  
  (monstertype,x,y,direction1,steps1,direction2,steps2,...)
  
  where directionn is nth direction and stepsn is nth number of steps.
  Directions and steps define the monsters path. Possible directions are:
  
  - none
  n north
  e east
  s south
  w west

  Number of steps is a positive whole number. The number of path instructions is
  limited to 30. There are two monster types:
  
  tr - troll
  gh - ghost
