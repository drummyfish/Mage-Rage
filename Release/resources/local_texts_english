intro_0:One day, at one of the most prestigious universities of magic, its headmaster, doctor of white
intro_1:magic, professor Starovous scheduled an urgent meeting. "Our colleague, Oren , who has been
intro_2:teaching advanced dark magic here at the university has gone too far with his research and
intro_3:decided to use his knowledge to take over the world. We must go to his castle and spoil his 
intro_4:childish plans."

intro_10:In order to keep the university safe the professor takes two postgraduate students with him:
intro_11:Mia, a student of mental magic, and Metodej, who is studying magic of fire. They're heading
intro_12:for the castle by three separate ways - gardens, underground and from the north. Each one 
intro_13:holds a key to the main gate, at which they'll all meet and stop the evil professor Oren 
intro_14:afterwards. "Can I use this experience for my dissertation work?" Mia asks the professor. "We'll

outro_0:Oren was defeated as well as his evil plans. Mia and Metodej became famous thanks to their
outro_1:bravery and received their doctor's degree shortly after, while Mia dedicated a few pages of
outro_2:her work to the adventurous journey. Starovous couldn't even become more famous so he was
outro_3:just glad that he had time for reading once again. Congratulations.

how_to_play_0:You take control of one to three mages in each level. The goal is to get them all to the red gate
how_to_play_1:and not to be killed by any monster or flames. You can switch between the players with 1, 2 and 3      
how_to_play_2:keys. Each mage can move and use objects on the map with the ENTER (or F) key, which can also be used to
how_to_play_3:shift crates.  Each mage is capable of casting three spells (with Q, W and E keys) - two specific
how_to_play_4:ones plus teleport, which serves two mages to summon the third one to the place, at which they're
how_to_play_5:standing. The specific spells are telekinesis (shifting crates at long distances) and magic path
how_to_play_6:(creating collapsing floor squares) for Mia,  fireball (melting ice blocks) and fire cloak
how_to_play_7:(temporary fire protection) for Metodej and a light (kills ghosts) and regeneration (restoring 
how_to_play_8:other player's energy) for Starovous. Casting spells costs magical energy, which can be restored 
how_to_play_9:by drinking from fountains. Holding the SPACE key allows the camera to be moved.
lost:You have lost. Nevermind, try it again.
